## Functionality
A user will be prompted to login/sign up if they aren't already in order to access any page that isn't the homepage.

Upon logging in a user can access their own dashboard, which is where they can create a blog post, or view/edit any that are already existing.

If a user edits their blog post, they are presented with a view which allows them to edit the title/text/description of the post.

They can then update their post using the button at the bottom of the screen. 

The other option is to delete their blog post, which will permanently remove the file.

Users will be logged out after 36000 seconds and can otherwise choose to log out.

Whilst viewing blog posts, users can also submit comments onto the blogs, which will then show with their comment, name and date the comment was created.
